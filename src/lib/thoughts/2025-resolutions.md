Note: Updates will occur throughout the year.

### Trying New Things
1. The majority of my cooking last year was food prep/eating the same meal for weeks in a row. This year I'm going to make a new recipe once a month. 
2. There's a backlog of classic albums I still need to listen to. I'm going to listen to a new album once a month.

### Coding
3. I'm going to make >=1 high quality GitHub commit every day.

### Health and Fitness
4. Last year I ran my first-ever race, the YMCA Dallas 8-Mile Turkey Trot. This year I'm going to sign up for a race and beat my pace (9:53)
