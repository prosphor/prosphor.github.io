### Graduation
The biggest milestone I achieved this year was graduating college.
After taking leave for three semesters, I'm grateful to be still graduating in 2024.

### Music
By far my favorite album of this year was Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay.
My favorite single was Charli XCX's Talk talk with Troye Sivan from the brat remix.
Here's a list of my favorite songs released this year.

### Adventures
I visited three new countries this year:
1. Japan, where I climbed Mt. Fuji
2. Cambodia, where I spent Christmas in Angkor Wat
3. Vietnam, where I explored Hanoi
